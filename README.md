ðŸš• Smart Cost Estimator â€“ Ride Fare Prediction App

Smart Cost Estimator is a full-stack web application that analyzes real-world cost prices from popular ride services such as Ola, Uber, and Namma Yatri, and predicts fare estimates based on user input for distance and travel time. The app helps users make informed decisions by providing accurate ride cost predictions based on historical pricing patterns.

ðŸ§  Project Highlights:

Data Analysis (Python): Collected and analyzed ride fare data using Python to calculate average costs per kilometer and per minute for each ride service. Libraries such as Pandas and NumPy were used for efficient data processing and aggregation.

Machine Learning: Trained a model to predict ride fares using the analyzed data combined with user inputs for distance and travel time.

Frontend Web App: Built with React and Tailwind CSS, providing a clean, interactive, and mobile-responsive interface.

Prediction Logic: Implements a formula combining base fare, distance, duration, and ride-specific multipliers to generate accurate fare estimates in real-time.

This project enhanced my skills in Python-based data analysis, machine learning, and full-stack web development, integrating backend prediction logic with a responsive frontend interface for a practical, real-world application.
