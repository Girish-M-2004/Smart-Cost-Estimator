Smart Cost Estimator is a full-stack web application that analyzes real-world cost prices from popular ride services such as Ola, Uber, and Namma Yatri, and uses this data to predict fare estimates based on user input for distance and travel time.
The goal of this project is to help users make informed decisions when choosing a ride service by providing an estimate of the cost beforehandâ€”based on patterns and average pricing data collected across the platforms.

Project Highlights:

Data Analysis: Real ride fare data from Ola, Uber, and Namma Yatri was analyzed to find average costs per kilometer and per minute of travel.
Machine Learning: A trained model predicts ride fares using average metrics and user input (distance & time).
Frontend Web App: Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the UI is clean, interactive, and mobile responsive.
Prediction Logic: Uses a simple formula that combines base fare, distance, duration, and ride-specific multipliers.
